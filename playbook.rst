Run Your First Playbook
==============================

This document explains how to run your first FortiManager Ansible playbook.

--------------

With FortiManager Galaxy collection, you are always recommended to run
FortiManager module in ``httpapi`` manner. The first step is to prepare your
host inventory with which you can use ``ansible-vault`` to encrypt or
decrypt your secrets for the sake of confidentiality.

Prepare host inventory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

in our case we create a file named ``hosts``:

::

   [fortimanagers]
   fortimanager01 ansible_host=192.168.190.130 ansible_user="admin" ansible_password="password"
   fortimanager02 ansible_host=192.168.190.131 ansible_user="admin" ansible_password="password"

   [fortimanagers:vars]
   ansible_network_os=fortinet.fortimanager.fortimanager

Write the playbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Example
----------

in the example: ``test.yml`` we are going to create a script on FortiManager:

::

   - hosts: fortimanagers
     connection: httpapi
     collections:
     - fortinet.fortimanager
     vars:
      ansible_httpapi_use_ssl: yes
      ansible_httpapi_validate_certs: no
      ansible_httpapi_port: 443
     tasks:
      - name: Create a script on FortiManager.
        fmgr_dvmdb_script:
           adom: 'adom'
           state: 'present'
           dvmdb_script:
              desc: 'The script create via Ansible'
              type: 'cli'
              name: 'fooscript'
              content: |
                         config system global
                            set timezone 04
                         end

Parameter Usages
----------------

there are several mandatory options in the example:

-  **adom** : ``adom`` is the administrative domain that an API is going to run inside. In most cases, ``global`` or ``root`` is what you need.
-  **state** : ``state`` is indicating the action the module is going to take. by giving ``present``, the module will create or update the object, while ``absent`` tells the module to delete the object in the FortiManager.
-  other module specific parameters are defined differently, you can find their usages in each `module page`_.

Run the playbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   ansible-playbook -i hosts test.yml

you can also observe the verbose output by adding option at the tail:
``-vvv``.
